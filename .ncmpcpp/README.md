##Ncmpcpp config
Not much stuff, changed interface to alternative and tweaked colors to work with dark terminals. Also shows bitrate and has custom trackbar.

### Few issues
Currently some texts are colored blue which doesn't work well with some dark terminal themes(very hard to read). Must find a way to change filesystem and library browser text color.
