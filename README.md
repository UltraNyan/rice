# My rice configs
Here I keep my configs for desktops I post on 4chan. Also provide easy to follow documentation about the rice and how to install/use it.

##Desktop collections
*A bowl of rice, contains many rice grains.* Collection is a set of proper wallpaper, gtk theme, firefox CSS, terminal colors, windows manager theme, etc. Each collection has its own Wiki page with links to idividual rice grains(like a cool bash script or Awesome WM theme) to replicate a perfect rice bowl.

### Homura in swimsuit *WIP*
Mainly purple theme based on powerarrow theme from copycat killer.
